## About

* DSL for variable scoping / encapsulation for readability and organisation, by means of block indents and explicit variable declarations
* block is run in the context outside of it (as if you copy-paste the code from inside to outside the block)

## Setup
* Add the following to your `Gemfile`
  ```ruby
  gem 'var_block'
  ```
* then run `bundle install`
* to use:
  ```ruby
  require 'var_block'
  ```

## Examples

### Basic
```ruby
with fruit: 'apple' do |v|
  puts getvar(v, :fruit)
  # => apple
end
```

### Multiple
```ruby
with(
  fruit: 'apple',
  vegetable: 'bean'
) do |v|
  puts getvar(v, :fruit)
  # => apple
  puts getvar(v, :vegetable)
  # => bean
end
```

### Procs
```ruby
current_fruit = 'banana'

with fruit: -> { current_fruit } do |v|
  puts getvar(v, :fruit)
  # => banana
end
```

### Nesting
```ruby
with fruit: 'orange' do |v|
  puts getvar(v, :fruit)
  # => orange

  v.with vegetable: 'lettuce' do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :fruit)
    # => orange
    puts getvar(v, :vegetable)
    # => lettuce
  end

  v.with vegetable: 'onion' do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :fruit)
    # => orange
    puts getvar(v, :vegetable)
    # => onion
  end
end
```

### Overriding
```ruby
with fruit: 'orange' do |v|
  v.with fruit: 'banana' do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :fruit)
    # => banana
  end
end
```

### Merging
```ruby
with fruits: 'apple' do |v|
  v.merge fruits: 'banana'

  puts getvar(v, :fruits)
  # => apple
  #    banana
end
```

```ruby
with fruits: ['apple', 'banana'] do |v|
  v.merge fruits: ['grape', 'mango']

  puts getvar(v, :fruits)
  # => apple
  #    banana
  #    grape
  #    mango
end
```

```ruby
with fruits: ['apple', 'banana'] do |v|
  v.merged_with fruits: ['grape', 'mango'] do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :fruits)
    # => apple
    #    banana
    #    grape
    #    mango
  end

  puts getvar(v, :fruits)
  # => apple
  #    banana
end
```

### DSL Explanation
```ruby
with(
  fruit: 'apple',
  vegetable: -> { 'bean' }
) do |v|
  puts v.class
  # => VarBlock::VarHash
  puts v.is_a? Hash
  # => true

  # from above, notice that a VarHash extends a Hash
  # therefore you can also use any Hash method as well (only except `merge`) like below.

  # NOT RECOMMENDED. use `getvar(v, :fruit)` instead when getting the value as it automatically evaluates the value, amongst others things
  puts v[:fruit]
  # => 'apple'
  puts getvar(v, :fruit)
  # => 'apple'
  puts v[:vegetable]
  # => #<Proc:0x00...>
  puts getvar(v, :vegetable)
  # => 'bean'

  # NOT RECOMMENDED. use `v.with(fruit: 'banana')` block instead when overwriting the value, as encapsulation is the main purpose of this gem
  v[:fruit] = 'banana'
  v.with(fruit: 'banana') do
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Options
#### :truthy?
* mimics "AND" logical operator for merged variables
```ruby
with conditions: 1.is_a?(Integer) do |v|
  v.merge conditions: !false

  puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
  # => true
end
```

```ruby
with conditions: 1.is_a?(String) do |v|
  v.merge conditions: !false

  puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
  # => false
end
```

```ruby
condition1 = true
condition2 = true
condition3 = false
condition4 = true

with conditions: -> { condition1 } do |v|

  v.merged_with conditions: -> { condition2 } do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
    # => true
  end

  v.merged_with conditions: -> { condition3 } do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
    # => false

    v.merged_with conditions: -> { condition4 } do |v|
      # returns false because condition3 above is already false. This will not propagate and therefore would not run the proc above for condition4
      puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
      # => false
    end
  end
end
```

#### :any?
* mimics "OR" logical operator for merged variables
```ruby
with conditions: 1.is_a?(Integer) do |v|
  v.merge conditions: false

  puts getvar(v, :conditions, :any?)
  # => true
end
```

```ruby
with conditions: 1.is_a?(String) do |v|
  v.merge conditions: false

  puts getvar(v, :conditions, :any?)
  # => false
end
```

```ruby
condition1 = false
condition2 = false
condition3 = true
condition4 = false

with conditions: -> { condition1 } do |v|

  v.merged_with conditions: -> { condition2 } do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
    # => false
  end

  v.merged_with conditions: -> { condition3 } do |v|
    puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
    # => true

    v.merged_with conditions: -> { condition4 } do |v|
      # returns true because condition3 above is already true. This will not propagate and therefore would not run the proc above for condition4
      puts getvar(v, :conditions, :truthy?)
      # => true
    end
  end
end
```

### Classes & Instances
```ruby
class Fruit
  attr_accessor :name, :is_ripe

  def initialize(**args)
    args.each do |key, value|
      instance_variable_set("@#{key}".to_sym, value)
    end
    self
  end

  def self.set_edible(**args)
    @set_edible_proc = args[:if]
  end

  def self.set_inedible(**args)
    @set_inedible_proc = args[:if]
  end


  # usage example
  with(ripe_condition: -> { is_ripe }) do |v|
    set_edible if: -> { getvar(v, :ripe_condition) } 
  end

  with(unripe_condition: -> { !is_ripe }) do |v|
    set_inedible if: -> { getvar(v, :unripe_condition) }
  end



  def is_edible?
    instance_exec &self.class.instance_variable_get(:@set_edible_proc)
  end

  def is_inedible?
    instance_exec &self.class.instance_variable_get(:@set_inedible_proc)
  end
end

fruit = Fruit.new(name: 'apple', is_ripe: true)
fruit.is_edible?
# => true
fruit.is_inedible?
# => false

fruit = Fruit.new(name: 'banana', is_ripe: false)
fruit.is_edible?
# => false
fruit.is_inedible?
# => true
```

### Advanced
* you can specify a "scope"
```ruby
with fruit: 'apple' do |v|
  v.with fruit: 'banana' do |vv|
    vv.with fruit: 'grape' do |vvv|
      vvv.with fruit: 'mango' do |vvvv|
        puts getvar(v, :fruit)
        # => apple
        puts getvar(vv, :fruit)
        # => banana
        puts getvar(vvv, :fruit)
        # => grape
        puts getvar(vvvv, :fruit)
        # => mango
      end
    end
  end
end
```

* you can also store the variables, and use them for later use:
```ruby
my_variables = nil

with fruits: 'apple' do |v|
  v.merged_with fruits: 'banana' do |v|
    my_variables = v
  end
end

my_variables.merged_with fruits: ['grape', 'mango'] do |v|
  puts getvar(v, :fruits)
  # => apple
  #    banana
  #    grape
  #    mango
end
```

## Motivation
* I needed to find a way to group model validations in a Rails project because the model has lots of validations and complex `if -> { ... }` conditional logic. Therefore, in hopes to make it readable through indents and explicit declaration of "conditions" at the start of each block, I've written this small gem, and the code then has been a lot more readable and organised though at the expense of getting familiar with it.

## TODOs
* pass in also the `binding` of the current context where `getvar` is called into the variable-procs so that the procs are executed with the same `binding` (local variables exactly the same) as the caller context. Found [dynamic_binding](https://github.com/niklasb/ruby-dynamic-binding), but I couldn't think of a way to skip passing in `binding` as an argument to `getvar` in hopes to make `getvar` as short as possible
